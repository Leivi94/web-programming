When there are two options for an assignment (A and B), you can decide to do either of them or both.

All questions related to assignments should be sent to dat310help@googlegroups.com.

[This document](../HOWTO_GitHub.md) explains how to hand in the assignments on GitHub. For the codecademy assignments you don't need to submit anything.
